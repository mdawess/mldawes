# Flow Batteries

Modular, long-term energy storage that's self contained

Redox flow batteries vs. Li Ion batteries
1. **Structure and Mechanism**:
    
    - **Lithium-Ion Batteries**: These batteries store energy in solid electrodes. During discharge, lithium ions move from the anode to the cathode through an electrolyte, and electrons flow through an external circuit to do work. When charging, the ions move back to the anode.
    - **Redox Flow Batteries**: They consist of two liquid electrolyte solutions, the anolyte (anode electrolyte, i.e. negative side) and catholyte (cathode electrolyte, i.e. positive side), stored in separate tanks and pumped through a cell containing a membrane. The energy storage capacity is determined by the amount of electrolyte in the tanks. Redox reactions occur at the electrodes, allowing ions to pass through the membrane while electrons flow through an external circuit.
2. **Energy Density and Size**:
    
    - **Lithium-Ion Batteries**: Higher energy density, meaning they can store more energy in a smaller space. This makes them ideal for portable applications like smartphones, laptops, and electric vehicles.
    - **Redox Flow Batteries**: Generally have lower energy density and are larger, primarily due to the need for large tanks to store the electrolytes. This makes them more suitable for stationary applications like grid energy storage.
3. **Scalability and Flexibility**:
    
    - **Lithium-Ion Batteries**: Scaling up involves adding more battery cells, which can increase complexity and cost.
    - **Redox Flow Batteries**: Easily scalable by simply increasing the size of the electrolyte tanks. This also allows for independent scaling of power and energy capacity, a distinct advantage for grid applications where discharge duration can be varied.
4. **Lifespan and Degradation**:
    
    - **Lithium-Ion Batteries**: They degrade with each charge-discharge cycle, gradually losing capacity over time.
    - **Redox Flow Batteries**: Typically exhibit longer lifespans and less capacity loss over cycles, as the electrolytes can be replenished or replaced.
5. **Safety and Environmental Impact**:
    
    - **Lithium-Ion Batteries**: Can pose safety risks like overheating or fire under certain conditions. Recycling and disposing of these batteries also present environmental challenges.
    - **Redox Flow Batteries**: Generally considered safer with lower risk of overheating and often use more environmentally benign materials.
