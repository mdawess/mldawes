## Ingredients

- 1 cup arborio rice
- Few teaspoons of olive oil
- A lot of mushrooms (I like oyster, cremini, and shiitake)
- 2 shallots
- 3 cloves of garlic
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 1 cup chicken stock
- However much parmesan cheese you want
- 1 stick of unsalted butter
- Salt / pepper to taste

## Instructions

### Mushroom stock
The mushroom stock is an essential component of the risotto. You can make it multiple days in advance but DO NOT SKIP IT.

1. Pour the chicken stock into a pot and bring to a boil.
2. Remove the stems from the mushrooms and add them to the stock. Add some of the tops as well.
3. Let the stock infuse for 30 minutes to one hour, then transfer the stock to a container and refrigerate for 12-24 hours.

### Mise

1. Bring your mushroom stock to a boil and then reduce the heat to low. It's very important the stock stays hot to make sure the rice cooks.
2. Thinly chop and set aside ~1/4 cup of the mushrooms for garnish, very finely dice the rest.
3. Finely dice the shallots and garlic.
4. Shred a good amount of parmesan cheese, I usually use about 1/2 cup.

### Risotto

1. Heat a pan over medium-high heat and add the olive oil. The oil should move quickly around the pan.
2. Add the all the mushrooms and brown them. This takes a while since they have a lot of water. Be patient.
3. Once the mushrooms have browned, remove the thinly sliced mushrooms and set aside. Add the shallots and garlic and cook until the shallots are soft.
4. Add the rice and toast until is is lightly fragrant. Don't worry if it sticks a little.
5. Hopefully you see a bit of brown fond on the bottom of the pan. This is flavour. Add the white wine to deglaze and scrape it into the rice.
6. Once the wine is cooked down, begin adding ladlefulls of stock. Im not sure how much a ladle is, but the rice should be lightly covered with stock.
7. This part can be tiring, but it's worth it. Keep stirring the rice and adding stock until the rice is al dente. i.e. its not hard and doesnt taste raw. This will take ~30 minutes so its best with good music or company.
8. Once cooked to your liking, add a bit of salt and the butter. It will look a bit wet, but that's normal. Keep stirring until the butter is melted and the rice is creamy.
9. Add the parmesan cheese and stir. Keep tasting and adjust the salt until it tastes good to you.
10. Finish with pepper, the reserved mushrooms, a drizzle of olive oil, and some more parmesan cheese.
