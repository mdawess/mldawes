*The dish in the middle, inspired by my favorite restaurant in Barcelona and The Bazaar by Jose Andres in DC*

## Ingredients

- 1 medium? octopus. I got it from a local market.
- 1/2 cup of olive oil
- Paprika, salt, pepper. Roughly 1 tablespoon each.
- 2 lemons (one for garnish)
- 2 shallots
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 1/2 cup of dry white wine

## Instructions

1. Cut the octopus tentacles off and stab a skewer through each one. This will keep it straight and help it cook evenly. Very lighly salt and add the paprika, and pepper with a bit of oil.
2. Finely dice the shallots and garlic and add them to the bag.
3. Sous vide the octopus for 5 hours at 75 degrees celcius. If you can go longer (e.g. 24 hours), drop the temp to 65 degrees and let it ride.
4. Once cooked, drain the liquid from the bag into a sauce pan and put the octopus in the fridge to relax.
5. Over medium heat, heavily reduce the cooking liquid until it is very thick. Add in the white wine and reduce again, followed by lemon zest and salt to taste. The sauce should be strong, we're going to use it as a glaze.
6. If you have a grill, fire it up. If you don't, use a pan. Put the octopus on the hot grill and brush it with the sauce. Go hot and fast, we don't want to lose the tenderness we earned over the last 5 hours.
7. Once charred to your liking, slice the octopus into ~1 inch pieces and add them to the plate. Char the other lemon on the grill and add it to the plate.
8. Enjoy!
