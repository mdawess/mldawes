# Earl Grey Ice Cream

*We ate it too fast to take a pic. Highly, highly recommend!*

## Ingredients

- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 cup milk
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 6 Earl Grey tea bags
- 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped or vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Combine the heavy cream, milk, and vanilla bean / extract in a saucepot. Bring to a simmer.
2. Combine the sugar and eggs in a bowl and whisk until smooth.
3. Temper the eggs by slowly adding some of the warm cream / mike mixture to the eggs, whisking constantly. The eggs should feel warm but have no clumps.
4. Take the pot off the heat and add the egg mixture to the remaining cream / milk mixture, stirring constantly.
5. Return to the pot and heat the mixture until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Do not let it go past 70 degrees celcius.
6. Add the Earl Grey tea bags and let steep for 30 minutes to one hour.
7. Once cooled, transfer the mixture to a container (I prefer plastic chefs containers, any will do) and refrigerate for 12-24 hours.
8. Using an ice cream maker, churn the mixture for 20-25 minutes.
9. Add into a container and freeze for 4-6 hours.
10. Serve. I really like it with a slice of warm date cake.
